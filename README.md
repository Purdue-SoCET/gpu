SoCET in-house GPU implementation

SoCET Graphics Processing Unit team is split into three subteams: (1) hardware team, (2) compilers team, and (3) graphics workflow. 

In Fall 2025, the GPU team will develop functional and cycle accurate simulator that can simulate graphics workload. 

## projects
### Emulator
The emulator is a functional simulator that simulates the architectural correctness of the hardware. It can help validate software and compiler's effort, as well as provide expected output for the cycle-accurate simulator or RTL.

### Simulator
simulator is a cycle-accurate simulator that details the microarchitecture of the GPU.
Performance counters should also be included to study the bottleneck of the design.
